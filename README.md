# My Portfolio

A portfolio of deployed web applications



This portfolio began with starter code provided as a template to build from courtesy of the Bootcamp. However, I chose to build my html and css from scratch and so I did away with the starter code, for better or for worse...

This portfolio showcases varying projects whether underway or upcoming as part of my learning as a web-developer. I have included some 'coming soon' titles to projects that will eventuall be filled with content.
